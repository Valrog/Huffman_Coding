# Huffman_Coding
An implementation of the Huffman coding algorithm in C++.

Note that this is merely a demonstration of the algorithm, and as such the encoded file will be larger than the initial file that is to be encoded. This is due to the fact that every code is written into an ordinary text file and consequently does not save any space, since the '0' and '1' codes do not actually take two bits.
